# Contrastive pretraining for discourse change detection

The repository contains the code used for running the experiments that are presented in the Data Science Master's thesis *Contrastive pretraining in discourse change detection* (2022, University of Helsinki). The following guidelines provide instructions on how to use the code for replicating different parts of the experiments. Most of them require access to a high performance computing environment, unless only a very small subset of the data is used.
